    # A word on aliases:
    #   Install command aliases for the debugger shell.
    #
    #   Each alias is actually a bit of code that will be compiled
    #   into the middle of a sub{$code} function and then called
    #   whenever the command matches.
    #
    #   The result of running the code is then evaled. The following
    #   code translates our user's shell commands into an alternate
    #   command.

    # Aliases the command restart_at(N) to rat(N) for the perl5db.pl
    # debugger.
