=head1 NAME

Enbugger::Restarts - Reach around in your stack and restart execution
from arbitrary places

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Here's a quick example of redefining a function you're currently in,
then restarting execution from the start.

    Loading DB routines from perl5db.pl version 1.3
    Editor support available.
    
    Enter h or `h h' for help, or `man perldebug' for more help.
    
    main::foo(blarg:2):	foo()
      DB<1> sub foo { print "Hello world!\n" } # new version
    
      DB<2> rat 1
    
      DB<3> c
    Hello world!





=head1 DESCRIPTION

I'm trying to get a little of Smalltalk's debugger features for Perl
5. The standard Perl debuggers all let you redefine functions
including functions that are currently executing. This extension
allows you to restart execution at the beginning of whatever is
currently at some point on your call stack.

The below functions describe a call stack:

  two();
  sub two { three() }
  sub three { five() }
  sub five { seven() }
  sub seven { ... }


  main
      -> two
          -> three
              -> five
                  ->seven
                  <-
              <- five
          <- three
      <- two
  <- main

The C<restart_at> extension lets you restart a particular level:

  sub seven { DB::restart_at(3) if $not_restarted++ }

  main
      -> two
          -> three
              -> five
                  ->seven
                      restart_at( 3 )
          -> three
              -> five
                  -> seven
                  <-
              <- five
          <- three
      <- two
  <- main
